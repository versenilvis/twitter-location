## 2.  Legal Terms

By submitting a contribution, you represent and warrant that:

- It is your original work, or you have sufficient rights to submit it.
- You grant the Twitter Location maintainers and users the right to use, modify, and distribute it under the 0BSD license (see LICENSE file)

We do not require a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). However, by contributing, you agree to license your submission under terms compatible with the 0BSD License and to grant the patent rights described above. If your contribution includes third-party code, you are responsible for ensuring it is 0BSD-compatible and properly attributed.

Where permitted by law, you waive any moral rights in your contribution (e.g., the right to object to modifications). If such rights cannot be waived, you agree not to assert them in a way that interferes with the project’s use of your contribution.
